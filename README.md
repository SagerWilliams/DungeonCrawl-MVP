# DungeonCrawl
What can you do in DungeonCrawl?
* DungeonCrawl is a simple RPG game aimed at being a quick and fun experience. This is a React Native app so it's likely to be played by younger kids due to it's simple gameplay.
* DungeonCrawl was made to test my ability to brainstorm ideas and execute a Minimum Viable Product in two days.
* The user can attempt to clear floors by passing a 'skill check'. The user can loot gold to buy health potions to survive longer in the dungeon. The player can also level up and choose to improve their attack or defense abilities.

* Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
* What did you learn from the process
* What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
* Writing tests
* Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

Any non-MVP tickets (optional)
Code refactorings
Performance Optimizations
Additional features
etc
Notes from your Sprint Retro
What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?
