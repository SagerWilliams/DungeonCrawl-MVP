# DungeonCrawl
What can you do in DungeonCrawl?
* DungeonCrawl is a simple RPG game aimed at being a quick and fun experience. This is a React Native app so it's likely to be played by younger kids due to it's simple gameplay.
* DungeonCrawl was made to test my ability to brainstorm ideas and execute a Minimum Viable Product in two days.
* The user can attempt to clear floors by passing a 'skill check'. The user can loot gold to buy health potions to survive longer in the dungeon. The player can also level up and choose to improve their attack or defense abilities.
